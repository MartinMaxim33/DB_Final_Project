To run our program, run tables-register.py. This will pull up our home page of our sports website automatically and 
provide links in the terminal window to the localhost address. From there you can go into each league page on the home screen, where you will find 
data about that specific league. You will also find Standings on the home page and a dashboard 
for relevant data across all leagues. But the data for league specific things are in those tabs 
We elected not to include a fantasy portion because that is really a separate entity and usually
is not on a website like this. Plus it would've doubled the length of time our project took.
